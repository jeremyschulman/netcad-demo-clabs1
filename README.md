# Demo - NetCadCam using ContainerLab

This respository contains a "Hello, world!" example of using the NetCadCam
toolkit.  The  network testbed is a
[containerlab](https://containerlab.srlinux.dev/) system comprised of three
Arista cEOS instances.

The primary purpose of this repo is to allow anyone interested in the NetCadCam
project to see a working example of design files and how they are used to
validate the operational state of the network.  Inclusively:

  * The ability to generate the network checks and validate the operational state of the network
  * The ability to generate the cEOS configuration files
  * The ability to generate the containerlabs topology file
  * See how NetCadCam can be extended to include containerlab CLI features
